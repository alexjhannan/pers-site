		<p>Hi! My name is Alex, and <span className="accentText">I’m a self-taught developer</span> in NYC.</p> 
		<p>A year ago, I was teaching <span className="accentText">calculus and physics</span> at a private high school. Disappointing career options had my eyes wandering towards other paths. The market is pushing towards tech, like it always has, and I have always been a techy at heart. It just made sense to make the switch.</p>
		<p>I was a bit skeptical of the canned education that bootcamps were offering, and I was also pretty confident in managing an educational plan. <span className="accentText">So, I taught myself how to code.</span> It didn’t hurt that I studied physics in school and had already learned many of the underlying concepts. <span className="accentText">Before I knew it, I was building and deploying web pages by myself.</span> Nowadays, I play with design on top of the full stack, and am always looking for the next skill to add to my capabilities.</p>
		<p>If you’re a part of a team that’s interested in an <span className="accentText">ambitious and independent coder</span>, or a client interested in hiring for some contract work, please <span className="accentText">feel free to email me</span> at alexjhannan@gmail.com! I am currently looking for both full-time positions and contracts.</p>
		<p>Thanks, and have a great day!</p>
